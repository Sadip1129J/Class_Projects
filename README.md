HTML Portfolio Exercises


This project contains a collection of HTML exercises designed to demonstrate various core concepts of web development and HTML5 structure. The solutions are consolidated into a single webpage stylized with modern CSS.

File Information

File Name: exercise.html
Description: A single HTML document containing solutions to four distinct web development exercises.

     * Column spanning (`colspan`)
   - Styled with distinct headers and borders.

4. Exercise 4: Semantic Structure
   - Illustrates the use of semantic HTML5 tags to define document structure.
   - Elements used:

     * <article>: Independent content
     * <aside>: Sidebar/Related content
     * <footer>: Copyright and contact info

Technologies Used

- HTML5: Core structure and semantic markup.
- CSS3 (Vanilla): Custom styling via `styles.css` containing responsive design, typography, and layout utilities matching the previous design.

How to Run

1. Ensure both `exercise.html` and `styles.css` are in the same directory.
2. Simply double-click the `exercise.html` file to open it in your default web browser.
   OR
3. Right-click the file -> "Open with" -> Select your preferred browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

Notes

- Images are loaded from external sources (Unsplash), so an internet connection is recommended for images to display.
- No external CSS frameworks or CDNs are required for styling; it is fully self-contained in `styles.css`.
