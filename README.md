This project contains a collection of HTML exercises designed to demonstrate various core concepts of web development and HTML5 structure. The solutions are consolidated into a single webpage stylized with modern CSS.

Technologies Used

- HTML5: Core structure and semantic markup.
- CSS3 (Vanilla): Embedded custom styling containing responsive design, typography, and layout utilities matching the previous design.


Steps to Run the Project
1.  Locate the `exercise.html` file in the project folder.
2.  Double-click the file to open it in your default web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
3.  Alternatively, right-click the file, select Open with and choose your preferred browser.

Notes

- Images are loaded from external sources (Unsplash), so an internet connection is recommended for images to display.
- No external CSS frameworks or CDNs are required for styling; it is fully self-contained within the HTML file.
